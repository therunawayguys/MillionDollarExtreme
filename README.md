You can call me Dirk or Dash â€” those aren't my real names.
I'm a 21 year old guy living in God knows where. Doxx me.
I'm not very extraordinary, just a regular dude who draws.
My conditions, mental or otherwise aren't your business,
however I will state for the record that I'm DX'd autistic.

I mostly keep to myself but I don't mind having some chats.
I have interests that could be considered "controversial",
though I enjoy them critically & w/o support in some cases.
I am blunt and I don't really care about your opinions on me.

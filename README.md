I'm not very extraordinary, just a regular 21 year old guy tryna live my best life. My conditions, mental or otherwise aren't your business, but I will state for the record that I'm diagnosed with autism. I can be blunt and I bully my friends for fun, however the general consensus is to not take anything I say too seriously.`

Try not to approach me at all if you're under 16.`
